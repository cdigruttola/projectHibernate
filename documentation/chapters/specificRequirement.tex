\begin{document}
	This section contains all of the functional and quality requirements of the system. It gives a detailed description of the system and all its features.
	\section{External interface Requirements}
		This section provides a detailed description of all inputs into and outputs from the system. It also gives a description of the hardware, software and communication interfaces and provides basic prototypes of the user interface.
	\subsection{User interfaces}
		For each access users of the application should see the log-in page, to provide credentials and authenticate.

		When logged, users must be able to search practices and work on it. The open practices ordered by due date will listed once the user logged in successfully. He can choose to visualise the open, the closed, the suspended and all the practices using tabs as showed in figure.

		The user can open the practice simply clicking on the ID. The link redirects user to the practice details to view and modify it. Each practice has an essential section about the type, the customer, date about it and the object. Another section is about activities done and working hours on it.\\

	\subsection{Hardware interfaces}
		The web portal does not need to have any direct hardware interfaces.\\
		The hardware connection to the database server is managed by the underlying operating system on the web server. 
	\subsection{Software interfaces}
		The communication between database and the web portal consists of operation concerning both reading and modifying the data.
	\subsection{Communications interfaces}
		The communication between different parts of the system is important since they depend on each other. However, in what way the communication is achieved is not important for the system and is therefore handled by the underlying operating system for the web portal. 
	\section{Functional requirements}
		 This section includes the requirements that specify all the fundamental actions of the software system.
	\section{Performance requirements}
		The requirements in this section provide a detailed specification of the user interaction with the software and measurements placed on the system performance.
	\section{Design constraints}
		This section includes the design constraints on the software caused by the hardware.
	\section{Software system attributes}
		The requirements in this section specify the required reliability, availability, security and maintainability of the software system.
